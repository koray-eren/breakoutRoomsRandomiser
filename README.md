Uses:
- randomise groups for a given instance: run as is
- run many iterations and see statistics for how many times each person was matched with another (i.e. how well the randomisation worked)

Our coderacademy group (16 people including James and Iryna) are hardcoded in for now

For reference, 30 iterations still results in cases where a given person is in the same room as another person 1 time
